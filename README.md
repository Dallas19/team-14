# team-14 (United Way of San Antonio)
SOLUTION:
We came up with two web pages, one for internal stakeholders and one for external stakeholders.
External stakeholders would be able to see the data that represents the collective impact made by its strategies over a period of time.
Internal stakeholders would be able to see even more detailed data, showing each program's progress. 
It would also display what areas for each program were doing well over a period of time, and which ones had room for improvement.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Data: Used excel to extract and analyzed the data then converted it to JSON files

Backend: Used Python to formulate data so that we could see a correlation between Strategy and Progress compared to the performance metrics 
in relation to the target metric. 

Frontend: Used HTML, CSS, Reactjs to create mock UI. Users can filter through impact and strategy, and display the graph info from there
